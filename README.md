# Solutions to LeetCode Problems

Here I will be posting more solutions to several popular leetcode problems, most of which are already available on the LeetCode website or the internet. The focus here however lies at presenting different ways of handling edge cases and initialization for iterative and recursive implementations. Another focus lies at presenting different ways of variable handling for recursive implementations (i.e. either global variable use or passing as argument) as well as presenting some find and exit recursive implementations.
